        <h1>Welcome To Ghana's leading Computer Science Department</h1>
        <p>This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically.<br> At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.

            The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team.<br> The course also provides the platform for further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer Science.
            
            The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>

<p>
    Graduate research, creation of knowledge, and solving problems are an integral part of our heritage and who we are today.Our commitment to and emphasis on the deep learning characteristic of graduate education is visible. 

We are a diverse, inclusive community of scholars, rising to society’s challenges in Ghana, Africa, and the world.<br> Students, faculty, and staff work closely across departments. If you are a prospective student, we invite you to further explore our PhD, MS, and certificate programs. I also encourage you to visit us and see for yourself what our faculty, campus, and our unique location have to offer. Our combination of unique and exciting research opportunities and proximity to the beauty of the campus provide a stimulating place to do what graduate students have always done—learn more, ask questions, and take on new challenges.

Once again, welcome to the UG Department of Computer Science! 
I wish you every success in your graduate education.
</p><br>Jamal-Deen Abdulai, Doctor of Philosophy<BR>
